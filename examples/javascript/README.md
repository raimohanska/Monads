## Javascript monad thingies

In the works. So far you can do

    npm install -g sweet.js
    npm install
    grunt

Which will re-build `examples.js` from `examples.sjs` using sweet.js macros I've stolen from [here](https://github.com/puffnfresh/sweet-fantasies).

Then you can

    node examples.js

To see if it works.
