Here be your Haskell Monad assignements.

Go and try to implement each of the Monad instances.

You might try them from easiest to the hardest:

1. [Id](Id/Id.hs)
2. [Option](Option/Option.hs)
3. [List](List/List.hs)
4. [Async](Async/Async.hs)
5. [State](State/State.hs)

If you're a cheater or want to compare your monads against mine, 
you might want to look under the `examples` directory.
