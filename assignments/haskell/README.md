Here be your Haskell Monad assignements.

Go and try to implement each of the Monad instances.

You might try them from easiest to the hardest:

1. Id
2. Option
3. List
4. Async
5. State

If you're a cheater or want to compare your monads against mine, 
you might want to look under the `examples` directory.
