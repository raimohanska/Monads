Here be your Haskell Monad challenges.

Go and try to implement each of the Monad instances.

You might try them from easiest to the hardest:

1. [Identity](Identity)
2. [Try](Try)
3. [List](List)
4. [State](State)
5. [Async](Async)

If you're a cheater or want to compare your monads against mine, 
you might want to look under the `examples` directory.
