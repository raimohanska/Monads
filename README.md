## Raimo's Monad Preso

The Monad is a simple and powerful abstraction, yet often
considered complex and hard to understand. I'll discuss monads
from a practical perspective, starting from Javascript examples
and diving into the beautiful world of Haskell. Time permitting,
everyone gets to craft their own Monad in Haskell.

The presentation is `presentation/index.html`.

There are ready examples in the `examples` directory.

The assignments for the workshop can be found in the `assignments` directory.

Work hard and have fun!
